## UX
### Strategy

The primary objective of this website is to showcase Natures Hideaway glamping site as an attractive destination for anyone looking to explore the outdoors while still enjoying an element of luxury. The business objectives can be measured by how many enquires to book there are.

### Scope

Utilising a minimalist styling, the website is simply laid out, allowing the user to navigate intuitively, browsing accomadtion types and also finding out about other facilaties and nearby attraction.

### Structure

This fictional glamping site currently has four types of accommodation, but allowing for growth and development of the business I wanted to make this easily scalable. With that in mind and designing for mobile first, I went with an instagram-style card layout. Where each option from the glamping.html page would appear in single file, one directly under the previous. This also made changing the layout for larger screens straight forward.

There are one or two slight differences from the wireframe mockup to the actual site, most notably is the omission of the fourth 'Facilities' page. Although this is not in the current site I think it would be a good idea for future features of the project.

I decided to prioratise key pieces of information, making them visible to the user without the need for any extra navigation. The number of beds a dwelling has and the number of people it can accommodate are ranked top, they were given easily recognisable icons that that sit neatly at the bottom of each dwelling card. Next or just as important, was the call to action 'Book' button, which invited users to book that accommodation right away. For the scope of this project, this call to action directs the user to the contact page where they can send a message.
